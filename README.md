First Figma Project Music Player 
UI/UX Project 01: Music Player

I'm thrilled to share my very first UI/UX project, Music Player, which i designed at very first as a beginner to figma. As a beginner this project highlights my passion for creating exceptional user experiences and visually stunning designs. This project encompasses the scenario of selecting a song from a album and plays it in a very joyful background.

Key Features:

Simple Layout Design
Easy Navigation Between Interfaces

Challenges:
As a beginner it is a bit challenging to identify the tools in figma.

Design Process:

I search how a music player works and from where to where i need to connect each interface. It is easy because we use music player in day-today life. Challenge is to design a simple and understandable design for every user even without lot of technical knowledge.

Visual Design: When selecting colors , i used dark colors for songs list, and light colors when playing a song. Challenge is, my color balancing might not meet the actual users color preferences. So in the settings , the user can change the colors and themes as they prefer. 

Through this project, I learned the tools of figma, and improved skills in wireframing and prototyping. 

I'm proud as this is my first UI/UX project and with the human factor design theory i hope to upgrade the design to meet every customer requirement and satisfaction.
Feel free to explore the project
